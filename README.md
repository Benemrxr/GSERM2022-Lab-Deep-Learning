# GSERM Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Applications

![Course Banner](banner.png)

Welcome to our GSERM course **Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Applications**, taught by **Prof. Dr. Damian Borth** and **Prof. Dr. Korbinan Riedhammer**.  In this course, theoretical sessions and practical hands-on coding lab sessions alternate to provide a better learning experience. The guided coding labs will be (partially) thaught by **Marco Schreyer**.

The lab materials for Python programming, Machine Learning und Deep Learning are available in and accessible through this repository.

Please use a laptop computer for the lab courses (not a tablet) to be able to fully participate in the labs.

Happy Coding!
